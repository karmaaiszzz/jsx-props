JSX: javascript XML

1. It must return only one component/div or fragment
2. To wrap all the fragments, we can use React.Fragment(shortcut <>...</>)instead of div => it groups elements without adding extra node 3.
3. Components can be nested(one component can include/call many other components)
4. Shortcut for app.jsx rafce(React Arrow Function Component with Export)
5. Properties are written in camel case (eg: objectFit, onClick, onHoover....)
6. React strict mode runs each code twice to ensure there is no error in production
7. Props is an object
8. We can take data as {props.bookDetails.bookImage} but since it is a hassle, we use object destructure.
